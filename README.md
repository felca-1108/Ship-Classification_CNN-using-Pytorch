# Ship-Classification_CNN-using-Pytorch
The goal of this project is to make a multi-class image classification of ships using a Convolutional Neural Network built with Pytorch.

There are 7.629 images for training and 1.070 images for validation and ten classes, as shown below:

- Aircraft Carrier
- Bulkers
- Car Carrier
- Container Ship
- Cruise
- DDG
- Recreational
- Sailboat
- Submarine
- Tug

For this classification problem, we are going to use AlexNet, a well known convolutional neural network. We'll use Pytorch library to work on this project. 

The dataset is provided in KAGGLE, in the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oleksandershevchenko/ship-classification-dataset/data .
